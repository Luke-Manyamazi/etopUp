Problem Statement:
Many prepaid electricity and water users face challenges when topping up their meters due to reliance on keypads. Currently, users must purchase a token from retail outlets or online, then manually enter it on a keypad near the meter. 
This process has several limitations, including the risk of losing paper tokens, the inconvenience of sending tokens to someone on-site, unavailability of tokens at retailers, and the inability to top up when stores are closed. 
Additionally, faulty keypads can prevent successful recharges.

To address these issues, we propose developing a web app that enables direct meter top-ups, eliminating the need for keypads. 
This app will allow users to purchase tokens seamlessly from vendors, ensuring continuous availability. 
Users will be able to top up from anywhere, check balances, review purchase history and usage reports, and manage multiple meters with ease, improving convenience and accessibility.
