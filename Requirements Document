etopUp App
Requirements Document

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a web application that allows users to top up their prepaid electricity and water meters seamlessly. 
The app aims to eliminate reliance on physical keypads and paper tokens by providing a digital solution.

1.2 Scope
The application will:
•	Enable users to purchase top-ups online.
•	Directly credit the meter with the purchased top-up, eliminating manual token entry.
•	Support multiple payment methods.
•	Provide secure authentication and transaction history tracking.
•	Allow users to register a new meter and validate it with the vendor.
•	Allow users to delete a registered meter.
•	Be designed with future expansion into a mobile app for both Android and iOS.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Authentication
•	Users can sign up with an email and password.
•	Users can log in securely using authentication mechanisms.
•	Password reset functionality should be available.

2.2 Meter Management
•	Users can register a new meter by providing the required details.
•	The system validates the meter with the vendor before adding it.
•	Users can delete a registered meter if no pending transactions exist.

2.3 Top-Up Purchase Process
•	Users can enter their meter number to initiate a top-up.
•	The system should validate the meter number before proceeding.
•	Users can select a payment method (credit/debit card, mobile money, PayPal, etc.).
•	Upon successful payment, the system directly credits the meter with the purchased amount.
•	A confirmation email or SMS is sent to the user.

2.4 Payment Integration
•	Support for Stripe, PayPal, and mobile money payment gateways.
•	Secure transaction handling with error recovery mechanisms.
•	Users can view their transaction history.
2.5 Meter Top-Up Processing
•	The system will integrate directly with utility companies' APIs to apply top-ups automatically to meters.
•	If API integration is unavailable, a fallback option for digital token generation will be considered.

2.6 User Dashboard
•	Displays meter top-up history.
•	Shows wallet balance (if a wallet system is introduced).
•	Allows users to manage their account details.

3.3 Usability & Accessibility
•	Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
•	High-contrast UI elements for accessibility.
•	Simple and intuitive navigation.
