etopUp App
Requirements Document

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a web application that allows users to top up their prepaid electricity and water meters seamlessly. 
The app aims to eliminate reliance on physical keypads and paper tokens by providing a digital solution.

1.2 Scope
The application will:
•	Enable users to purchase top-ups online.
•	Generate digital tokens for manual entry or directly credit meters where possible.
•	Support multiple payment methods.
•	Provide secure authentication and transaction history tracking.
•	Be designed with future expansion into a mobile app for both Android and iOS.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Authentication
•	Users can sign up with an email and password.
•	Users can log in securely using authentication mechanisms.
•	Password reset functionality should be available.

2.2 Top-Up Purchase Process
•	Users can enter their meter number to initiate a top-up.
•	The system should validate the meter number before proceeding.
•	Users can select a payment method (credit/debit card, mobile money, PayPal, etc.).
•	Upon successful payment, a digital token is generated and displayed.
•	A confirmation email or SMS is sent to the user.

2.3 Payment Integration
•	Support for Stripe, PayPal, and mobile money payment gateways.
•	Secure transaction handling with error recovery mechanisms.
•	Users can view their transaction history.

2.4 Meter Top-Up Processing
•	Initially, users will enter the generated token manually.
•	Future implementation may include direct integration with meter providers.

2.5 User Dashboard
•	Displays meter top-up history.
•	Shows wallet balance (if a wallet system is introduced).
•	Allows users to manage their account details.
